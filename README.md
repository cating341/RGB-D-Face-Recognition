# RGB-D-Face-Recognition

Simple RGB-D face recognition implementation. 
- Input: Combine RGB and Depth images into 4 channels input data
- Network: ResNet

Dataset We used is BU-3DFE (Binghamton University 3D Facial Expression) Database. Due to the license, we cannot provide any related data. If you need it, please request the dataset by yourself [[link]](http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~lijun/Research/3DFE/3DFE_Analysis.html). Then, reproject the 3D face model into RGB and D images.
